	Your class project is an opportunity for you to explore an interesting machine
	learning problem of your choice in the context of a real-world data set. Below,
	you will find some project ideas, but the best idea would be to combine machine
	learning with problems in your own research area. Your class project must be
	about new things you have done this semester; you can't use results you have
	developed in previous semesters. In short, a typical project consists of picking an interesting dataset,
	applying one or more appropriate and well-known machine learning techniques for an interesting task as baselines,
	and extending these baselines in creative and interesting ways.

	<ul>
	  <li>Projects can be done in teams of 2-4 students. Team members
	  are responsible for dividing up the work
	  equally and making sure that each member contributes.</li>

  <li> If you are having trouble writing a proposal, feel free to
	  consult with a TA or the instructor.  Once you submit your proposal,
	  we will give you feedback. Of course the final responsibility to
	  define and execute an interesting piece of work is yours </li>

	  <li>Each project will be assigned a 10601 TA as a project
	  consultant/mentor.</li>

	  <li>You are strongly urged to consult a TA or the instructor early on if your
	  project will rely purely on simulated data or if you intend to do a learning
	  theory related project. A theory project should look at a concrete technical open question,
	  analyze relevant literature, and develop insightful and interesting attempts.
	  Links to open problems can be found <a href="http://orfe.princeton.edu/conferences/colt2014/for-authors/announcements/announcement-2013-02-03">here</a>.
	  </li>
	</ul>Your project will be worth 20% of your final class grade, and will have 4
	deliverables:

	<ul>
	  <li><b>Proposal, March 6</b>: 1 page (10%)</li>

	  <li><b>Midway Report, April 6</b>: 5-8 pages (25%)</li>

	  <li><b>Poster Presentation, May 11</b>: (20%)</li>

	  <li><b>Final Report, May 8</b>: 10 pages (45%)</li>
	</ul>Note that all write-ups must be in the form of a <a href=
	"http://nips.cc/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NIPS paper</a>. The page limits are
	strict! Papers over the limit will not be considered. Each deliverable of your
	project will be evaluated based on several factors:

	<ul>
	  <li>The novelty of the project ideas and applications. The groups are
	  encouraged to come up with original ideas and novel applications for the
	  projects. A project with new ideas (algorithms, methods, theory) on ML or new,
	  interesting applications of existing algorithms is scored higher than a project
	  without much new idea/application.</li>

	  <li>The extensiveness of the study and experiments. A project that
	  produces a more intelligent system by combining several ML
	  techniques together, or a project that involves well-designed
	  experiments and thorough analysis of the experimental results, or a
	  project that nicely incorporates various real world applications,
	  are scored higher.</li>

	  <li>The writing style and the clarity of the written paper.</li>

		  below). You'd want the shorter dimension to be less than 36'' since the
		  special poster printers use paper rolls of width 36''.</li>

		  <li>You can create a bunch of "normal" presentation slides, print out each
		  one on a piece of (letter-sized) paper, and put them all together on a
		  poster board. This is somewhat messier (and not as pretty) but you don't
		  need to wait for the special poster printer to print.</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>

	  <li>We will provide you with foam boards onto which you can tack on your poster
	  (or your slides for the poster). The foam boards are 32'' by 40''.</li>

	  <li>Printing: Unfortunately, we don't have a budget to pay for printing. If you
	  are an SCS student, SCS has a poster printer you can use which prints on a 36''
	  wide roll of paper. See <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/poster_printing.html">SCS Poster Printing</a>
	  for more details </li>
	</ul>If you are a student outside SCS, you will need to check with your
	department to see if there are printing facilities for big posters (we're not
	sure what is offered outside SCS), or just print a collection of
	regular sized pages and attach them to the poster board.

  <b>Vector Space Models for Natural Language Processing</b><br />
  <br />
  Many tasks in natural language processing can be performed with only very shallow
  understanding of text. The vector space model is one example of a useful, but
  shallow, data representation that has been successfully used for many tasks,
  including detecting synonyms, finding analogies, and learning properties of noun
  phrases. The vector space model represents the meaning of a noun phrase(NP) (e.g.
  "the New York Yankees" or "house") as a vector of co-occurrence counts with
  contexts. A context is a short snippet of text like "alex rodriguez plays for _" or
  "_ on the street". The model is essentially a (very) large matrix A, whose rows
  represent noun phrases and whose columns represent contexts. The value of entry
  A_{i,j} is the number of times noun phrase i occurred with context j in a large
  corpus of documents (e.g., the Web). Intuitively, this model contains useful
  information because some contexts only occur with certain types of noun phrases;
  for example, the context "athletes, such as _" only occurs with athletes.<br />

  Related Tools</a><br />
  <br />
  <u>Project ideas:</u><br />
  In this project, we will provide you with an NP-context co-occurrence matrix and
  ask you to do something interesting with it. Possible applications include finding
  synonyms, finding members of categories (i.e., "is this noun phrase an athlete?"),
  or clustering noun phrases to automatically induce categories. For more ideas, we
  recommend reading (1).<br />
  <br />
  Another interesting set of projects could use this data as a case study for
  learning in high-dimensions. These projects could examine how dimensionality
  reduction or regularization affect performance on one of the above tasks.<br />
  <br />
  Vector space models are also used for many other tasks, including document
  classification and topic modeling. The 20 Newsgroups data is a classic data set for
  these tasks. You can obtain <a href=

  <td align="justify"><b>Semi-Supervised Learning </b><br />
  <br />
  In many applications, it is easy to obtain a large amount of unlabeled data, but
  difficult or costly to label this data. Semi-supervised learning studies algorithms
  which learn from a small amount of labeled data and a large pool of unlabeled data.
  Interestingly, semi-supervised learning is not always successful, and unlabeled
  data points do not always improve performance. Semi-supervised learning algorithms
  typically make an assumption about the data distribution which enables learning --
  for example, several algorithms assume that the decision boundary should not pass
  through regions with high data density. When this assumption is satisfied, the
  algorithms perform better than supervised learning.<br />
  <br />
  The goal of this project is to experiment with semi-supervised learning algorithms
  on a data set of your choice. Some algorithms you can consider using are:
  co-training, self-training, transductive SVMS (S3VMs), or one of the many
  graph-based algorithms. (We recommend reading (1) for a survey of the many
  approaches to semi-supervised learning.) You may compare several semi-supervised
  and supervised algorithms on your data set, and perhaps draw some general
  conclusions about semi-supervised learning.<br />
  <br />
  This project can use essentially any data set. For some ideas, we recommend
  consulting the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning
  Repository</a>.<br />

  <td align="justify"><b>Privacy-Related Project Ideas</b><br />
  <br />
  A recent paper shows how decision trees may be approximated in the "secure
  multiparty" setting, by using tools of cryptography. This allows several parties to
  compute a decision tree on the union of their data without requiring them to share
  the data itself with each other. See <a href=
  "http://www.pinkas.net/PAPERS/id3-final.pdf">here</a> for the algorithm and
  <a href="http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=jpc">
  here</a> for a general discussion.<br />
  <br />
  An alternative notion of privacy which has received much attention lately is
  so-called "Differential Privacy" (see e.g, <a href=
  "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/databaseprivacy/dwork.pdf">here</a>.
  So far approaches have been studied for many machine learning methods under this
  model of privacy (such as logistic regression: see <a href=
  "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0071">here</a> and svm: see <a href=
  "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5708">here</a>. This notion of privacy is fundamentally
  different to the usual cryptographic one.<br />
  <br />
  The datasets for this project can be found at the <a href=
  "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html">UCI machine learning archive</a>
  (Please consult Rob Hall for more details about the datasets.).<br />
  <br />
  <u>Project Idea 1: Differentially Private Decision Trees</u><br />
  See whether it is possible to implement a decision tree learner in a
  differentially-private way. This would entail creating a randomized algorithm which
  outputs a decision tree. Furthermore, when one of the elements of the input data is
  changed, the distribution over the outputs should not change by much (cf, the
  definition of differential privacy). Analyze under what conditions the approach
  will work and analyze the error rate relative to that of the non-private decision
  tree.<br />
  <br />
  <u>Project Idea 2: Secure Multiparty EM</u><br />
  Implement EM for some kind of mixture model in a secure multiparty way (i.e.,
  making use of cryptography to protect the intermediate quantities). This has been
  studied already in the context of imputation (see <a href=
  "http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~rwright1/Publications/padm06.pdf">here</a>). Although
  in principle, existing cryptographic primitives may be used to compute any
  funciton, in order to get a reasonably efficient algorithm you will have to come up
  with approximations which are less expensive to compute. Analyze the effects of any
  such approximations you make.<br />
  <br />
  <u>Project Idea 3: Differentially Private Sparse Covariance Estimation</u><br />
  The estimation of gaussian covariance matrices has received ample attention lately
  (see e.g, <a href=
  "http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.ejs/1214491853">
  here</a>). When the covariance matrix is sparse (i.e., the off-diagonal elements
  are mostly 0) then there is a nice correspondence between the multivariate
  gaussian, and a certain type of undirected graphical model. See whether it is
  possible to estimate sparse covariance matrices in a way which satisfies the
  definition of differential privacy as shown above. Analyze how much error will be
  in the algorithm compared with the non-private one.<br />

  <br />
  The KDD Cup is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition in which
  some of the best data mining teams in the world compete to solve an practical data
  mining problem of some importance. The 2010 challenge was about discovering how
  generally or narrowly do students learn? How quickly or slowly? Will the rate of
  improvement vary between students? What does it mean for one problem to be similar
  to another? It might depend on whether the knowledge required for one problem is
  the same as the knowledge required for another. But is it possible to infer the
  knowledge requirements of problems directly from student performance data, without
  human analysis of the tasks? This year's challenge asks you to predict student
  performance on mathematical problems from logs of student interaction with
  Intelligent Tutoring Systems. This task presents interesting technical challenges,
  has practical importance, and is scientifically interesting.<br />

  <b>Image Segmentation Dataset</b><br />
  The goal is to segment images in a meaningful way. Berkeley collected three hundred
  images and paid students to hand-segment each one (usually each image has multiple
  hand-segmentations). Two-hundred of these images are training images, and the
  remaining 100 are test images. The dataset includes code for reading the images and
  ground-truth labels, computing the benchmark scores, and some other utility
  functions. It also includes code for a segmentation example. This dataset is new
  and the problem unsolved, so there is a chance that you could come up with the
  leading algorithm for your project.<br />

  Dataset</a><br />
  <br />
  <u>Project idea:</u> Region-Based Segmentation<br />
  Most segmentation algorithms have focused on segmentation based on edges or based
  on discontinuity of color and texture. The ground-truth in this dataset, however,
  allows supervised learning algorithms to segment the images based on statistics
  calculated over regions. One way to do this is to "oversegment" the image into
  superpixels (Felzenszwalb 2004, code available) and merge the superpixels into
  larger segments. Graphical models can be used to represent smoothness in clusters,
  by adding appropriate potentials between neighboring pixels. In this project, you
  can address, for example, learning of such potentials, and inference in models with
  very large tree-width.<br />

  <td align="justify"><b>Character recognition (digits) data</b><br />
  Optical character recognition, and the simpler digit recognition task, has been the
  focus of much ML research. We have two datasets on this topic. The first tackles
  the more general OCR task, on a small vocabulary of words: (Note that the first
  letter of each word was removed, since these were capital letters that would make
  the task harder for you.)<br />
  <br />
  <a href="../../../../ai.stanford.edu/~btaskar/ocr/index.html">Download dataset.</a><br />
  <br />
  Project suggestion:<br />
  * Use an HMM to exploit correlations between neighboring letters in the general OCR
  case to improve accuracy. (Since ZIP codes don't have such constraints between
  neighboring digits, HMMs will probably not help in the digit case.)<br />
